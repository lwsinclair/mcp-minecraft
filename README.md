# Minecraft MCP Integration

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for Minecraft that enables AI assistants to interact with a Minecraft server. This integration allows AI models to observe and interact with the Minecraft world through a bot.

## Prerequisites

1. Minecraft Launcher
2. Node.js 18 or higher
3. Claude Desktop App
4. Java 21.0.5 (recommended)

> ⚠️ Note: Currently only tested on macOS/Linux. Windows compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Important Note

1. **Use the F3+P Shortcut**:
Press F3 + P together. This toggles the "Pause on Lost Focus" feature. Once turned off, you can switch to claude desktop and Minecraft will continue running without pausing.

2. **Connection Issues on Claude Restart**:
If you restart Claude while the Minecraft server is running, you may experience MCP connection issues on the next claude launch due to lingering java process. See [Troubleshooting: MCP Connection Failed](#common-issues) for resolution steps.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download and Setup Minecraft Server**
   - Download Minecraft server v1.21 from [mcversions.net/1.21](https://mcversions.net/download/1.21)
   - Install Java 21.0.5 if not already installed (other versions are untested)
   - Create a dedicated directory (e.g., `~/minecraft-server/`)
   - Place the downloaded `server.jar` file in this directory
   - Note down the absolute path to your `server.jar` file

2. **Install and Configure MCP Integration**
   
   Quick Install (Recommended):
   ```bash
   npx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-minecraft --client claude
   ```
   Follow the CLI prompts to complete the setup.

   Or Manual Setup:
   - Navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Add the MCP server configuration:   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-minecraft": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "mcp-minecraft@latest",
           "--server-jar",
           "/absolute/path/to/minecraft-server/server.jar"
         ]
       }
     }
   }   
   ```
   > ⚠️ Replace `/absolute/path/to/minecraft-server/server.jar` with your actual server.jar path

4. **Launch Claude Desktop**
   - Start Claude Desktop after completing the configuration

5. **Connect to Server**
   - Open Minecraft Launcher
   - Install and launch Minecraft Java Edition **v1.21**
   - Click "Play" and Select "Multiplayer"
   - Click "Add Server"
   - Enter server details:
     - Server Name: `Minecraft Server`
     - Server Address: `localhost:25565`
   - Click "Done"

## Technical Details

- Bot username: MCPBot

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Connection Failed**
   - Look for lingering Java processes
   - Terminate them manually:
      - Windows: Use Task Manager (untested)
      - Mac/Linux: 
         - Go to 'Activity Monitor' and 'Force Quit' java
   - Restart computer if process termination fails
   - Note: Latest version should auto-resolve these issues

2. **Server Won't Start**
   - Verify Java is installed
   - Check server.jar path is correct
   - Ensure port 25565 is available

3. **Can't Connect to Server**
   - Verify server is running (check logs)
   - Confirm you're using "localhost" as server address
   - Check firewall settings

### Logs Location
- Minecraft Server logs: Check the minecraft-server directory
- Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
